# (my) Awesome learning resouces 📚

Personal list of programming related learning resources.

I starred a lot of repos on GitHub and bookmarked / pinboarded / Instapapered a lot of great resources on the Internet.
Unfortunatley I've never had time to read them all. Maybe when I categorize them in a nice and easy-to-read list I'll finally read them? 😅
